            <h2>What is eduID?</h2>
            <p>
              eduID is a federated identity - a user identity that can be used
              in several different organisations that have agreed on how
              identities will be managed. The basic idea is that a given user,
              who is authenticated with an organisation, is automatically
              authenticated with other organisations in the federation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Federated identities are one of the cornerstones of trust between
              organisations. Trust is based on all the organisations relying on
              all the others to carry out their authentication - identification
              and verification - properly and in a controlled and reliable IT
              environment. This is why eduID is certified by
              <a class="text-link" href="https://kantarainitiative.org/"
                >Kantara</a
              >.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Why have eduID?</h2>
            <p>
              From the student's perspective, in the long-term eduID means fewer
              accounts to keep track of during studies. For many organisations,
              identity management is a complex issue and it is necessary to work
              with confirmed users.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many services that require identification of users. This
              is often done by the user entering an email address to which the
              service provider sends a password - and for many services is this
              a sufficient level. Such a user is normally called unconfirmed,
              because the service provider does not really know who the user
              with that email address is. Through the use of eduID,
              identification of users is taken up a level to that of confirmed
              users.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>How do I use eduID?</h2>
            <p>
              Once you have created your account, you will hardly ever need to
              log in to eduID. You will only be using your account to create and
              access other accounts, such as
              <a class="text-link" href="https://www.universityadmissions.se"
                >universityadmissions.se</a
              >
              or your student account.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Log in at eduid.se when you:</strong><br />
              ♦ Accept your place at university<br />
              ♦ Organise your student account for email and intranet<br />

              What are the selected methods of verifying an id number for eduID?
            </h2>
            <p>At this moment, verifying an id number can be done via:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>
                <span>Post:</span> The user receives a letter with a code sent
                to their home address as registered at Skatteverket (the Swedish
                Tax Agency)
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Mobile:</span> The user receives a message sent to the

              <li>
                <span>Freja eID (digital ID-card):</span> The user will be
                directed to the Freja eID website to use their service. If you
                don't have Freja eID you have to create it separately before
                you can complete verification of your eduID
              </li>

            <h2>What is the eduID privacy policy?</h2>
            <p>
              The user data procedure of eduID follows the intent of the General
              Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The information that is sent is
              about you as an individual. When you log into a service using
              eduID, one or more pieces of personal information are sent to the
              service in order to identify you as a user. Which information
              eduID sends is depending upon the type of service involved, the
              purpose of the service and what information eduID is willing to
              deliver to the service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on need, a service gets access to a unique identifier or
              your user name + e-mail address. This unique identifier is unique
              to that specific service and cannot be shared or traced between
              different services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services that are categorised in SWAMID’s metadata with entity
              categories receive attributes in accordance with SWAMID’s
              recommendations, see below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services whose primary purpose is for the benefit of research and
              education have access to approximately the same personal data
              which are automatically sent with an everyday email, that being
              name, email address, user identity and that the user has an
              account at eduID. Registered services that via GÉANT Data
              Protection Code of Conduct adhere to GDPR, get access to the same
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services whose purpose is for students to process admissions,
              course registrations, examination sign-up, degree applications,
              internships, grant applications, self-service account
              administration have access to the user’s Swedish personal identity
              number or Swedish higher education interim personal identity
              number for foreigners. Your personal identity number might be
              given to other services, where there is a separate contract
              between the service and eduID. Such a contract shall allways be in
              accordance with the Swedish Personal Data Act.

              ORCID is integrated into many research-related services, such as
              systems used by publishers, funders and institutions. ORCID is an
              independent non-profit organisation that provides a persistent
              identifier – an ORCID iD – that distinguishes you from other
              researchers and a mechanism for linking your research outputs and
              activities to your ORCID iD.
