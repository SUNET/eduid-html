                                            <h3>What is eduID?</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                eduID is a federated identity - a user identity that can be used in several
                                                different organisations that have agreed on how identities will be managed.
                                                The basic idea is that a given user, who is authenticated with an organisation,
                                                is automatically authenticated with other organisations in the federation.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Federated identities are one of the cornerstones of trust between organisations.
                                                Trust is based on all the organisations relying on all the others to carry out
                                                their authentication - identification and verification - properly and in a
                                                controlled and reliable IT environment. This is why eduID is certified by

                                            <h3>Why have eduID? </h3>
                                            <p>
                                                From the student's perspective, in the long-term eduID means fewer accounts
                                                to keep track of during studies. For many organisations, identity management
                                                is a complex issue and it is necessary to work with confirmed users. SUNET
                                                has been working with the issue of identity management for a long time and
                                                developed eduID to make things easier for all parties in the higher education
                                                community.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                There are many services that require identification of users. This is
                                                often done by the user entering an email address to which the service
                                                provider sends a password - and for many services is this a sufficient
                                                level. Such a user is normally called unconfirmed, because the service
                                                provider does not really know who the user with that email address is.
                                                Through the use of eduID, identification of users is taken up a level
                                                to that of confirmed users.

                                                When you log into a service using eduID, one or more pieces of personal
                                                information are sent to the service in order to identify you as a user.
                                                Which information eduID sends is depending upon the type of service involved,
                                                the purpose of the service and what information eduID is willing to deliver
                                                to the service. This procedure follows the intent of the Swedish Personal

                                            <p>
                                                Freja eID is a service that is free of charge and which resembles Mobile bankID, but there is no need to link it to a bank account.
                                                In short, you install the Freja eID app on your mobile device (iOS or Android), register and verify an email address
                                                and upgrade to Freja eID+ by entering the reference number found on your ID card, take a photo of yourself
                                                and visit the nearest ATG agent that can be found using the map function in the Freja eID app.
                                                On site, you ask the agent to start the verification process by scanning the QR code displayed in the mobile app.
                                                After that, you have wait a couple of hours until you are informed that you have passed the ID verification.
                                                When that is done, you can log into eduID using your mobile and confirm your identity through Freja eID.
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>I visited the ATG agent for verification of my identity, but they didn't know what to do</strong><br>
                                                Make sure that the agent that you visited is an authorized agent and can be found on the Freja eID's map.
                                                The service Freja eID is completely new to all parties, and there might still be some agents that are not fully aware of it.
                                                Ask them to scan the QR code that is displayed in the Freja eID app so that the ID verification process opens up in their terminal.
                                                All the ATG agent have to do after that, is to follow the instructions shown in their terminal.

                                                The default language in eduID is based on the language setting that your
                                                browser uses. To change the default language you can log into eduID
                                                and select the language you want under the personal information tab.

                                                You can update your personal information and your profile there. These

                                                When you use eduID to log into a service, your personal information is forwarded to that service.  However, the service in question does not necessarily use the personal information from eduID. The display name, for those services that use it, is assumed to be your first name or well-known nickname.

A message will be sent to your inbox at Min myndighetspost (minmyndighetspost.se).
