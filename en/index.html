                                        <h3>Are you going to study at university?</h3>
                                        <p>Did you know that you need something called a confirmed account at antagning.se to get your place at university? You have to wait for a letter for that. Exactly - by snail mail. Don't live at your registered address? Then it will be a real hassle. But wait - there's a solution. You can create an eduID account online right away.</p>
                                        <h3>Are you already studying?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            You can use eduID to get a student account for your email and intranet once you are admitted. If you change university, just arrange a new account with eduID. Easy! And do you sometimes lose passwords? We can fix that too.<br />
                                            So, to recap. Just one single login to keep track of.

                                                <p>eduID is a federated identity - a user identity that can be used in several different organisations that have agreed on how identities will be managed. The basic idea is that a given user, who is authenticated with an organisation, is automatically authenticated with other organisations in the federation.</p>
                                                <p>Federated identities are one of the cornerstones of trust between organisations. Trust is based on all the organisations relying on all the others to carry out their authentication - identification and verification - properly and in a controlled and reliable IT environment. This is why eduID is certified by Kantara. <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">https://kantarainitiative.org/</a></p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <h3>Why have eduID? </h3>
                                                <p>From the student's perspective, in the long-term eduID means fewer accounts to keep track of during studies. For many organisations, identity management is a complex issue and it is necessary to work with confirmed users. Sunet has been working with the issue of identity management for a long time and developed eduID to make things easier for all parties in the higher education community.</p>
                                                <p>There are many services that require identification of users. This is often done by the user entering an email address to which the service provider sends a password - and for many services is this a sufficient level. Such a user is normally called unconfirmed, because the service provider does not really know who the user with that email address is. Through the use of eduID, identification of users is taken up a level to that of confirmed users.</p>
                                            </li>

                                                <h3>How do I use eduID?</h3>
                                                <p>Once you have created your account, you will hardly ever need to log in to eduID. You will only be using your account to create and access other accounts, such as antagning.se or your student account.</p>

                                                <p>When you log in to a service using eduID, one or more pieces of personal information are sent to the service in order to identify you as a user. Which information eduID sends is depending upon the type of service involved, the purpose of the service and what information eduID is willing to deliver to the service. This procedure follows the intent of the Swedish Personal Data Act. The information that is sent is about you as an individual.</p>
                                                <p>Depending on need, a service gets access to a unique identifier or your user name + e-mail address.  This unique identifier is unique to that specific service and cannot be shared or traced between different services.</p>

                                                <p>Services whose primary purpose is for the benefit of research and education have access to approximately the same personal data which are automatically sent with an everyday email, that being name, email address, user identity and that the user has an account at eduID. Registered services that via GÉANT Data Protection Code of Conduct adhere to the European Union’s data protections directives, in Sweden the Personal Data Act, get access to the same information.</p>

                                                    Add your National Identity Number in the field on the "Confirm your identity" page to start the process of confirming your civic registration number.  A message will be sent to your inbox at Min myndighetspost (minmyndighetspost.se). In the message sent to Min myndighetspost there is a code that you can use to confirm your National Identity Number in eduID, which means that your eduID will also be confirmed. Once you have confirmed your eduID you will be able to log in to services that require a confirmed eduID, such as antagning.se.

                                                    Add a mobile phone number that is registered in your name. Select "confirm mobile number" as described below.<br/>

Select the option "confirm identity with registered mobile phone number". The mobile phone number you enter will be checked with the Swedish telephone register to confirm that the number is registered in your name. Note that if you are under 18 and the mobile phone number is registered in your parent's or guardian's name, this is also considered to confirm your National Identity Number.
